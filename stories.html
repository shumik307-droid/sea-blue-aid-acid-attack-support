        <h3>Story 2: Strength Through Learning</h3>
        <p>A student was attacked while on the way to college, leaving her disfigured and fearful of stepping outside. The psychological impact was overwhelming, and social stigma created isolation. Thanks to financial aid, rehabilitation programs, and a dedicated support network, she was able to resume education and pursue her dreams. Her determination and courage inspired others in the community to provide support and advocate for protection against such violence. She now mentors young survivors, empowering them to regain confidence and independence.</p>

        <h3>Story 3: Hope Restored</h3>
        <p>After an acid attack left a survivor socially isolated, depression, anxiety, and self-doubt made daily life extremely challenging. Regular emotional support, therapy sessions, and peer groups gradually helped rebuild confidence and self-esteem. Slowly, engagement with the world resumed, and sharing the story publicly raised awareness about acid attacks. Through this journey, the survivor demonstrated the transformative power of hope, compassion, and resilience in overcoming trauma and inspiring others.</p>
